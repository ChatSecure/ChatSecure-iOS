ChatSecure
=========

ChatSecure is a very simple IM client for iOS that integrates encrypted "Off the Record" messaging support from the [libotr](http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/) library. It uses the [LibOrange](https://github.com/unixpickle/LibOrange) library to handle all of the OSCAR functionality and the [xmppframework](http://code.google.com/p/xmppframework/) to handle XMPP (in progress).

Compatibility
=========
Tested

* [Adium](http://adium.im/) - OTR works over both XMPP and Oscar.

Untested

* [Pidgin](http://pidgin.im/) (with [pidgin-otr](http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/index.php#downloads) plugin)
* [Gibberbot](https://guardianproject.info/apps/gibber/)
