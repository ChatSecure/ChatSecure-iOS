[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chrisballinger/ChatSecure-iOS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chrisballinger/ChatSecure-iOS)

[ChatSecure](https://chatsecure.org) is a free and open source instant messaging client for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chatsecure/id464200063) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.otr.app.im&hl=en) that integrates encrypted [OTR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatSecure_Messaging) ("Off the Record") messaging support from the [libotr](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/) library and the [XMPPFramework](https://github.com/robbiehanson/XMPPFramework/) to handle Jabber/GTalk (XMPP).


## Cost

This project is **100% free** because it is important that all people around the world have unrestricted access to privacy tools.
However, developing and supporting this project is hard work and costs real money. Please help support the development of this project! We now also accept Bitcoin via Coinbase! :)

## Compatibility


There's a more [full list of OTR clients on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging#Client_support).


### Desktop

* [Adium](https://adium.im/) (Mac OS X)
* [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org) (Cross-platform)
* [Pidgin](https://pidgin.im/) (cross-platform), with [pidgin-otr](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/index.php#downloads) plugin.

### Mobile

* [ChatSecure-Android](https://guardianproject.info/apps/chatsecure/) (formerly known as Gibberbot)

* [Conversations](https://github.com/siacs/Conversations) (Android)

## Build Instructions

You'll need [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org) for most of our dependencies.
    
    $ gem install cocoapods
    
Download the source code and **don't forget** to pull down all of the submodules as well.

    $ git clone https://github.com/chrisballinger/ChatSecure-iOS.git
    $ cd ChatSecure-iOS/
    $ git submodule update --init --recursive
    
Now you'll need to build the dependencies. During this process we will automatically verify the integity of each package by checking its GPG signature. Install [GPGTools](https://gpgtools.org) and add the public signing keys for OpenSSL, GnuPG, libevent, and libotr. *(TODO make these links to the keys)*
    
    $ bash ./Submodules/CPAProxy/scripts/build-all.sh
    $ bash ./Submodules/OTRKit/scripts/build-all.sh
    $ pod install
    
Next you'll need to create your own version of environment-specific data. Make a copy of `OTRSecrets-Template.m` as `OTRSecrets.m`:

    $ cp ChatSecure/OTRSecrets-Template.m ChatSecure/OTRSecrets.m
    $ cp ./configurations/OTR_Codesigning.xcconfig.sample ./configurations/OTR_Codesigning.xcconfig
    
Then set your own value for `PROVISIONING_PROFILE_Debug` in `OTR_Codesigning.xcconfig` to your iOS team provisioning profile identifier to run it on your device. You can get this identifier by temporarily selecting the desired profile in Xcode (Build Settings -> Provisiong Profile), then selecting "Other...".

Open `ChatSecure.xcworkspace` in Xcode and build. 

*Note*: **Don't open the `.xcodeproj`** because we use Cocoapods now!

If you're still having trouble compiling check out the Travis-CI build status and `.travis.yml` file.
