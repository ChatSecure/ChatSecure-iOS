ChatSecure
=========

ChatSecure is a free and open source instant messaging client for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chatsecure/id464200063) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.otr.app.im&hl=en) that integrates encrypted [OTR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging) ("Off the Record") messaging support from the [libotr](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/) library and the [XMPPFramework](https://github.com/robbiehanson/XMPPFramework/) to handle Jabber/GTalk (XMPP).


Cost
=========

This project is **100% free** because it is important that all people around the world have unrestricted access to privacy tools.
However, developing and supporting this project is hard work and costs real money. Please help support the development of this project! We now also accept Bitcoin via Coinbase! :)

Build Instructions
========
Install [mogenerator](http://rentzsch.github.io/mogenerator/) in order to regenerate the Core Data model files.
    
    $ brew install mogenerator
    
Download the source code and **don't forget** to pull down all of the submodules as well.

    $ git clone git@github.com:chrisballinger/Off-the-Record-iOS.git
    $ cd Off-the-Record-iOS/
    $ git submodule update --init --recursive
    
Make your own version of environment-specific data. Make `OTRSecrets.m` file with blank API keys, and set your provisioning profile ID in `OTR_Codesigning.xcconfig`. To find the provisioning profile ID, go to Project Settings -> Build Settings -> Code Signing -> Select Provisiong Profile -> Select Other -> Copy Profile's UUID into `OTR_Codesigning.xcconfig`.

    $ cp "Off the Record/OTRSecrets-Template.m" "Off the Record/OTRSecrets.m"
    $ cp "Off the Record/configurations/OTR_Codesigning.xcconfig.sample" "Off the Record/configurations/OTR_Codesigning.xcconfig"

    
Open `Off the Record.xcodeproj` in Xcode and build.
