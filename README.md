ChatSecure
=========

ChatSecure is a very simple IM client for iOS that integrates encrypted "Off the Record" messaging support from the [libotr](http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/) library. It uses the [LibOrange](https://github.com/unixpickle/LibOrange) library to handle all of the OSCAR functionality and the [xmppframework](http://code.google.com/p/xmppframework/) to handle XMPP.
