[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ChatSecure/ChatSecure-iOS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ChatSecure/ChatSecure-iOS)

[ChatSecure](https://chatsecure.org) is a free and open source [XMPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP) messaging client for iOS that integrates [OTR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging) and [OMEMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMEMO) encrypted messaging support, and has optional integrated support for connectivity via the [Tor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)) network.

## Cost

### Redistributing ChatSecure Code on the App Store

Even though this project is open source, this does not mean you can reuse this code when distributing closed source commercial products. Please [contact us](mailto:chris@chatsecure.org) to discuss licensing options before you start building your product.

If you are an open source project, please [contact us](mailto:chris@chatsecure.org) to arrange for an App Store redistribution exception. For more information about why this is required, please read [this blog post](https://whispersystems.org/blog/license-update/) from Open Whisper Systems.

### Cost for End Users

Downloading the ChatSecure app is **100% free** because it is important that all people around the world have unrestricted access to privacy tools.
However, developing and supporting this project is hard work and costs real money. Please help support the development of this project!

## Localization

If you would like to contribute/improve a translation:

 1. Visit our [Transifex project page](https://www.transifex.com/chrisballinger/chatsecure/) and make an account if you don't have one already.
 2. Go to the resources subsites `AppStore.strings` & `Localizable.strings` to add a new language or improve an existing translation. 
 3. [Open an issue on Github](https://github.com/ChatSecure/ChatSecure-iOS/issues) notifying us of your translation.


## Compatibility

There's a more [full list of OTR clients on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging#Client_support). A smaller list of clients support the mobile-friendly [OMEMO Encryption](https://omemo.top/).

### Desktop

* [dino](https://dino.im) (Linux, macOS, Windows) **Supports OMEMO**

### Mobile

* [Conversations](https://conversations.im) (Android) **Supports OMEMO**

## Build Instructions

You'll need [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) installed for most of our dependencies.
    
    $ gem install cocoapods
    
Download the source code and **don't forget** to pull down all of the submodules as well.

    $ git clone https://github.com/ChatSecure/ChatSecure-iOS.git
    $ cd ChatSecure-iOS/
    $ git submodule update --init --recursive
    
Now you'll need to build the dependencies.
    
    $ bash ./Submodules/CPAProxy/scripts/build-all.sh
    $ bash ./Submodules/OTRKit/scripts/build-all.sh
    $ pod repo update
    $ pod install
    
Next you'll need to create your own version of environment-specific data. Make a copy of `Secrets-template.plist` as `Secrets.plist`:

    $ cp OTRResources/Secrets-template.plist OTRResources/Secrets.plist
    
You'll need to manually change the Team ID under Project -> Targets -> ChatSecure -> Signing. The old .xcconfig method doesn't seem to work well anymore.

Open `ChatSecure.xcworkspace` in Xcode and build. 

*Note*: **Don't open the `.xcodeproj`** because we use Cocoapods now!

If you're still having trouble compiling check out the Travis-CI build status and `.travis.yml` file.
