/**
 * Configures the storage class, passing it's parent and the parent's dispatch queue.
 *
 * This method is called by the init methods of the XMPPStreamManagement class.
 * This method is designed to inform the storage class of it's parent
 * and of the dispatch queue the parent will be operating on.
 *
 * A storage class may choose to operate on the same queue as it's parent,
 * as the majority of the time it will be getting called by the parent.
 * If both are operating on the same queue, the combination may run faster.
 *
 * Some storage classes support multiple xmppStreams,
 * and may choose to operate on their own internal queue.
 *
 * This method should return YES if it was configured properly.
 * It should return NO only if configuration failed.
 * For example, a storage class designed to be used only with a single xmppStream is being added to a second stream.

/// ***** Optimizing storage demands during active stream usage *****
///
/// There are 2 methods that are invoked frequently during stream activity:
///
/// - setLastDisconnect:lastHandledByClient:forStream:
/// - setLastDisconnect:lastHandledByServer:pendingOutgoingStanzas:forStream:
///
/// They are invoked any time the 'h' values change, or whenver the pendingStanzaIds change.
/// In other words, they are invoked continually as stanzas get sent and received.
/// And it is the job of the storage layer to decide how to handle the traffic.
/// There are a few things to consider here:
///
/// - How much chatter does the xmppStream do?
/// - How fast is the storage layer?
/// - How does the overhead on the storage layer affect the rest of the app?
///
/// If your xmppStream isn't very chatty, and you've got a fast concurrent database,
/// then you may be able to simply pipe all these method calls to the database without thinking.
/// However, if your xmppStream is always constantly sending/receiving presence stanzas, and pinging the server,
/// then you might consider a bit of optimzation here. Below is a simple recommendation for how to accomplish this.
///
/// You could choose to queue the changes from these method calls, and dump them to the database after a timeout.
/// Thus you'll be able to consolidate a large traffic surge into a small handful of database operations.
///
/// Also, you could expose a 'flush' operation on the storage layer.
/// And invoke the flush operation when the app is backgrounded, or about to quit.


/**
 * This method is invoked immediately after an accidental disconnect.
 * And may be invoked post-disconnect if the state changes, such as for the following edge cases:
 *
 * - due to continued processing of stanzas received pre-disconnect,
 *   that are just now being marked as handled by the delegate(s)
 * - due to a delayed response from the delegate(s),
 *   such that we didn't receive the stanzaId for an outgoing stanza until after the disconnect occurred.
 *
 * This method is not invoked if stream management is started on a connected xmppStream.
 *
 * @param date
 *   This value will be the actual disconnect date.
